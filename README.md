**VoltAgent** is an open source TypeScript framework for building and orchestrating AI agents.
You can build production-ready agents with memory, workflows, tools, and built-in LLM observability.

## Why VoltAgent?

- **Production-Ready from Day One**: Ship agents with built-in memory, workflows, and observability instead of building infrastructure from scratch.
- **Code with Confidence**: Full TypeScript support with type-safe tools, automatic inference, and compile time safety across your entire agent system.
- **Debug Like a Pro**: Built-in VoltOps observability lets you trace every decision, monitor performance, and optimize workflows in real-time without external tools.
- **Build Complex Systems Simply**: Orchestrate multi-agent teams with supervisor coordination, declarative workflows, and modular architecture that scales from prototypes to production.

## Agent Development Platform

VoltAgent provides a complete platform for developing and monitoring AI agents through two complementary tools.

### Core Framework

With the core framework, you can build intelligent agents with memory, tools, and multi-step workflows while connecting to any AI provider. Create sophisticated multi-agent systems where specialized agents work together under supervisor coordination.

- **[Core Runtime](https://voltagent.dev/docs/agents/overview/) (`@voltagent/core`)**: Define agents with typed roles, tools, memory, and model providers in one place so everything stays organized.
- **[Workflow Engine](https://voltagent.dev/docs/workflows/overview/)**: Describe multi-step automations declaratively rather than stitching together custom control flow.
- **[Supervisors & Sub-Agents](https://voltagent.dev/docs/agents/sub-agents/)**: Run teams of specialized agents under a supervisor runtime that routes tasks and keeps them in sync.
- **[Tool Registry](https://voltagent.dev/docs/agents/tools/) & [MCP](https://voltagent.dev/docs/agents/mcp/)**: Ship Zod-typed tools with lifecycle hooks and cancellation, and connect to [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers without extra glue code.
- **[LLM Compatibility](https://voltagent.dev/docs/getting-started/providers-models/)**: Swap between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or other providers by changing config, not rewriting agent logic.
- **[Memory](https://voltagent.dev/docs/agents/memory/overview/)**: Attach durable memory adapters so agents remember important context across runs.
- **[Retrieval & RAG](https://voltagent.dev/docs/rag/overview/)**: Plug in retriever agents to pull facts from your data sources and ground responses (RAG) before the model answers.
- **[Evals](https://voltagent.dev/docs/evals/overview/)**: Ship guardrails faster by running agent eval suites alongside your workflows.

### VoltOps LLM Observability Platform

VoltAgent comes with built-in [VoltOps](#built-in-llm-observability-with-voltops) LLM observability to monitor and debug your agents in real-time with detailed execution traces, performance metrics, and visual dashboards. Inspect every decision your agents make, track tool usage, and optimize your workflows with built-in OpenTelemetry-based observability.

#### MCP Server (@voltagent/mcp-docs-server)

You can use the MCP server `@voltagent/mcp-docs-server` to teach your LLM how to use VoltAgent for AI-powered coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, or Windsurf. This allows AI assistants to access VoltAgent documentation, examples, and changelogs directly while you code.

📖 [How to setup MCP docs server](https://voltagent.dev/docs/getting-started/mcp-docs-server/)

## ⚡ Quick Start

Create a new VoltAgent project in seconds using the `create-voltagent-app` CLI tool:

```bash
npm create voltagent-app@latest
```

This command guides you through setup.

You'll see the starter code in `src/index.ts`, which now registers both an agent and a comprehensive workflow example found in `src/workflows/index.ts`.

```typescript
import { VoltAgent, Agent, Memory } from "@voltagent/core";
import { LibSQLMemoryAdapter } from "@voltagent/libsql";
import { createPinoLogger } from "@voltagent/logger";
import { honoServer } from "@voltagent/server-hono";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { expenseApprovalWorkflow } from "./workflows";
import { weatherTool } from "./tools";

// Create a logger instance
const logger = createPinoLogger({
  name: "my-agent-app",
  level: "info",
});

// Optional persistent memory (remove to use default in-memory)
const memory = new Memory({
  storage: new LibSQLMemoryAdapter({ url: "file:./.voltagent/memory.db" }),
});

// A simple, general-purpose agent for the project.
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "my-agent",
  instructions: "A helpful assistant that can check weather and help with various tasks",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: [weatherTool],
  memory,
});

// Initialize VoltAgent with your agent(s) and workflow(s)
new VoltAgent({
  agents: {
    agent,
  },
  workflows: {
    expenseApprovalWorkflow,
  },
  server: honoServer(),
  logger,
});
```

Afterwards, navigate to your project and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

When you run the dev command, tsx will compile and run your code. You should see the VoltAgent server startup message in your terminal:

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
VOLTAGENT SERVER STARTED SUCCESSFULLY
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
✓ HTTP Server: http://localhost:3141

Test your agents with VoltOps Console: https://console.voltagent.dev
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Your agent is now running! To interact with it:

1. Open the Console: Click the [VoltOps LLM Observability Platform](https://console.voltagent.dev) link in your terminal output (or copy-paste it into your browser).
2. Find Your Agent: On the VoltOps LLM Observability Platform page, you should see your agent listed (e.g., "my-agent").
3. Open Agent Details: Click on your agent's name.
4. Start Chatting: On the agent detail page, click the chat icon in the bottom right corner to open the chat window.
5. Send a Message: Type a message like "Hello" and press Enter.

### Running Your First Workflow

Your new project also includes a powerful workflow engine.

The expense approval workflow demonstrates human-in-the-loop automation with suspend/resume capabilities:

```typescript
import { createWorkflowChain } from "@voltagent/core";
import { z } from "zod";

export const expenseApprovalWorkflow = createWorkflowChain({
  id: "expense-approval",
  name: "Expense Approval Workflow",
  purpose: "Process expense reports with manager approval for high amounts",

  input: z.object({
    employeeId: z.string(),
    amount: z.number(),
    category: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
  }),
  result: z.object({
    status: z.enum(["approved", "rejected"]),
    approvedBy: z.string(),
    finalAmount: z.number(),
  }),
})
  // Step 1: Validate expense and check if approval needed
  .andThen({
    id: "check-approval-needed",
    resumeSchema: z.object({
      approved: z.boolean(),
      managerId: z.string(),
      comments: z.string().optional(),
      adjustedAmount: z.number().optional(),
    }),
    execute: async ({ data, suspend, resumeData }) => {
      // If we're resuming with manager's decision
      if (resumeData) {
        return {
          ...data,
          approved: resumeData.approved,
          approvedBy: resumeData.managerId,
          finalAmount: resumeData.adjustedAmount || data.amount,
        };
      }

      // Check if manager approval is needed (expenses over $500)
      if (data.amount > 500) {
        await suspend("Manager approval required", {
          employeeId: data.employeeId,
          requestedAmount: data.amount,
        });
      }

      // Auto-approve small expenses
      return {
        ...data,
        approved: true,
        approvedBy: "system",
        finalAmount: data.amount,
      };
    },
  })
  // Step 2: Process the final decision
  .andThen({
    id: "process-decision",
    execute: async ({ data }) => {
      return {
        status: data.approved ? "approved" : "rejected",
        approvedBy: data.approvedBy,
        finalAmount: data.finalAmount,
      };
    },
  });
```

You can test the pre-built `expenseApprovalWorkflow` directly from the VoltOps console:

![VoltOps Workflow Observability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b877c65-f095-407f-9237-d7879964c38a)

1.  **Go to the Workflows Page:** After starting your server, go directly to the [Workflows page](https://console.voltagent.dev/workflows).
2.  **Select Your Project:** Use the project selector to choose your project (e.g., "my-agent-app").
3.  **Find and Run:** You will see **"Expense Approval Workflow"** listed. Click it, then click the **"Run"** button.
4.  **Provide Input:** The workflow expects a JSON object with expense details. Try a small expense for automatic approval:
    ```json
    {
      "employeeId": "EMP-123",
      "amount": 250,
      "category": "office-supplies",
      "description": "New laptop mouse and keyboard"
    }
    ```
5.  **View the Results:** After execution, you can inspect the detailed logs for each step and see the final output directly in the console.
