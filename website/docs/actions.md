# Actions

VoltOps Actions provide managed integrations that you can trigger from agents, workflows, or the VoltOps API. Define the destination once in the VoltOps console, connect credentials, and call the action from the SDK with full observability.

For complete documentation, see the **[Actions & Triggers Docs](/actions-triggers-docs/)**.
