# Comparison Report: Agent Frameworks

## Introduction
This report compares two prominent agent frameworks based on architecture, observability, and extensibility. 

## Architecture
### Framework A
- Modular architecture consisting of perception systems, reasoning engines, and execution modules.
- Supports various agent types, including reflex and goal-based agents.

### Framework B
- Context-aware architecture emphasizing easy integration with external tools and APIs.
- Allows flexible modifications to agent behavior based on various contexts.

## Observability
### Framework A
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging features.
- Real-time metrics and tracing capabilities for performance insight.

### Framework B
- Standardized observability features focused on data collection and monitoring state changes.
- Visualization tools for debugging and performance tuning.

## Extensibility
### Framework A
- Allows integration of new modules and customization of agent behaviors easily.
- Provides a solid foundation for extending functionalities.

### Framework B
- Supports extensive customization through plugins and libraries.
- Enables seamless integration of external tools for specific business needs.

## Conclusion
Both frameworks offer unique strengths in architecture, observability, and extensibility. The recommendations for choosing a framework would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the intended application.
