### Patch Changes

- [#847](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/847) [`d861c17`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/d861c17e72f2fb6368778970a56411fadabaf9a5) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - feat: add first-class REST tool endpoints and UI support - #638
  - Server: list and execute registered tools over HTTP (`GET /tools`, `POST /tools/:name/execute`) with zod-validated inputs and OpenAPI docs.
  - Auth: Both GET and POST tool endpoints are behind the same auth middleware as agent/workflow execution (protected by default).
  - Multi-agent tools: tools now report all owning agents via `agents[]` (no more single `agentId`), including tags when provided.
  - Safer handlers: input validation via safeParse guard, tag extraction without `any`, and better error shaping.
  - Serverless: update install route handles empty bodies and `/updates/:packageName` variant.
  - Console: Unified list surfaces tools, tool tester drawer with Monaco editors and default context, Observability page adds a Tools tab with direct execution.
  - Docs: New tools endpoint page and API reference entries for listing/executing tools.

- Updated dependencies [[`d861c17`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/d861c17e72f2fb6368778970a56411fadabaf9a5)]:

### Patch Changes

- [#845](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/845) [`5432f13`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/5432f13bddebd869522ebffbedd9843b4476f08b) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - feat: workflow execution listing - #844

  Added a unified way to list workflow runs so teams can audit executions across every storage backend and surface them via the API and console.

  ## What changed
  - `queryWorkflowRuns` now exists on all memory adapters (in-memory, libsql, Postgres, Supabase, voltagent-memory) with filters for `workflowId`, `status`, `from`, `to`, `limit`, and `offset`.
  - Server routes are consolidated under `/workflows/executions` (no path param needed); `GET /workflows/:id` also returns the workflow result schema for typed clients. Handler naming is standardized to `listWorkflowRuns`.
  - VoltOps Console observability panel lists the new endpoint; REST docs updated with query params and sample responses. New unit tests cover handlers and every storage adapter.

  ## Quick fetch

  ```ts
  await fetch(
    "http://localhost:3141/workflows/executions?workflowId=expense-approval&status=completed&from=2024-01-01&to=2024-01-31&limit=20&offset=0"
  );

## 1.0.8

### Patch Changes

- [#810](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/810) [`efcfe52`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/efcfe52dbe2c095057ce08a5e053d1defafd4e62) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - fix: ensure reliable trace export and context propagation in serverless environments

  ## The Problem

  Trigger-initiated agent executions in serverless environments (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions) were experiencing inconsistent trace exports and missing parent-child span relationships. This manifested as:
  1. Agent traces not appearing in observability tools despite successful execution
  2. Trigger and agent spans appearing as separate, disconnected traces instead of a single coherent trace tree
  3. Spans being lost due to serverless functions terminating before export completion

  ## The Solution

  **Serverless Trace Export (`@voltagent/serverless-hono`):**
  - Implemented reliable span flushing using Cloudflare's `waitUntil` API to ensure spans are exported before function termination
  - Switched from `SimpleSpanProcessor` to `BatchSpanProcessor` with serverless-optimized configuration (immediate export, small batch sizes)
  - Added automatic flush on trigger completion with graceful fallback to `forceFlush` when `waitUntil` is unavailable

  **Context Propagation (`@voltagent/core`):**
  - Integrated official `@opentelemetry/context-async-hooks` package to replace custom context manager implementation
  - Ensured `AsyncHooksContextManager` is registered in both Node.js and serverless environments for consistent async context tracking
  - Fixed `resolveParentSpan` logic to correctly identify scorer spans while avoiding framework-generated ambient spans
  - Exported `propagation` and `ROOT_CONTEXT` from `@opentelemetry/api` for HTTP header-based trace context injection/extraction

  **Node.js Reliability:**
  - Updated `NodeVoltAgentObservability.flushOnFinish()` to call `forceFlush()` instead of being a no-op, ensuring spans are exported in short-lived processes

  ## Impact
  - ✅ Serverless traces are now reliably exported and visible in observability tools
  - ✅ Trigger and agent spans form a single, coherent trace tree with proper parent-child relationships
  - ✅ Consistent tracing behavior across Node.js and serverless runtimes
  - ✅ No more missing or orphaned spans in Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, or similar platforms

  ## Technical Details
  - Uses `BatchSpanProcessor` with `maxExportBatchSize: 32` and `scheduledDelayMillis: 100` for serverless
  - Leverages `globalThis.___voltagent_wait_until` for non-blocking span export in Cloudflare Workers
  - Implements `AsyncHooksContextManager` for robust async context tracking across `Promise` chains and `async/await`
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing Node.js deployments

  ## Migration Notes

  No breaking changes. Existing deployments will automatically benefit from improved trace reliability. Ensure your `wrangler.toml` includes `nodejs_compat` flag for Cloudflare Workers:

  ```toml
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  ```

  - Introduce the new `createTriggers` DSL and expose trigger events via sensible provider names (e.g. `on.airtable.recordCreated`) rather than raw catalog IDs.
  - Add trigger span metadata propagation so VoltAgent agents receive trigger context automatically without manual mapping.
  - Simplify action dispatch payloads: `payload` now contains only the event’s raw data while trigger context lives in the `event`/`metadata` blocks, reducing boilerplate in handlers.

  ```ts
  import { VoltAgent, createTriggers } from "@voltagent/core";

  new VoltAgent({
    // ...
    triggers: createTriggers((on) => {
      on.airtable.recordCreated(({ payload, event }) => {
        console.log("New Airtable row", payload, event.metadata);
      });

      on.gmail.newEmail(({ payload }) => {
        console.log("New Gmail message", payload);
      });
    }),
  });
  ```

  - Core now exposes managed-memory step APIs, and the VoltAgent managed memory adapter persists/retrieves steps through VoltOps.
  - LibSQL, PostgreSQL, Supabase, and server handlers provision the new `_steps` table, wire up DTOs/routes, and surface the data in Observability/Steps UI (including managed-memory backends).

### Patch Changes

- [#701](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/701) [`c4f01e6`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/c4f01e6691b4841c11d4127525011bb2edbe1e26) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - fix: observability spans terminating prematurely on Vercel Edge and Deno Deploy

  ## The Problem

  Observability spans were being cut short on Vercel Edge and Deno Deploy runtimes because the `toVercelEdge()` and `toDeno()` adapters didn't implement `waitUntil` support. Unlike `toCloudflareWorker()`, which properly extracted and set up `waitUntil` from the execution context, these adapters would terminate async operations (like span exports) as soon as the response was returned.

  This caused the observability pipeline's `FetchTraceExporter` and `FetchLogExporter` to have their export promises cancelled mid-flight, resulting in incomplete or missing observability data.

  ## The Solution

  Refactored all serverless adapters to use a new `withWaitUntil()` helper utility that:
  - Extracts `waitUntil` from the runtime context (Cloudflare's `executionCtx`, Vercel's `context`, or Deno's `info`)
  - Sets it as `globalThis.___voltagent_wait_until` for the observability exporters to use
  - Returns a cleanup function that properly restores previous state
  - Handles errors gracefully and supports nested calls

  Now all three adapters (`toCloudflareWorker`, `toVercelEdge`, `toDeno`) use the same battle-tested pattern:

  ```ts
  const cleanup = withWaitUntil(context);
  try {
    return await processRequest(request);
  } finally {
    cleanup();
  }
  ```

  ## Impact
  - ✅ Observability spans now export successfully on Vercel Edge Runtime
  - ✅ Observability spans now export successfully on Deno Deploy
  - ✅ Consistent `waitUntil` behavior across all serverless platforms
  - ✅ DRY principle: eliminated duplicate code across adapters
  - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with 11 unit tests covering edge cases, nested calls, and error scenarios

  ## Technical Details

  The fix introduces:
  - `utils/wait-until-wrapper.ts`: Reusable `withWaitUntil()` helper
  - `utils/wait-until-wrapper.spec.ts`: Complete test suite (11/11 passing)
  - Updated `toCloudflareWorker()`: Simplified using helper
  - **Fixed** `toVercelEdge()`: Now properly supports `waitUntil`
  - **Fixed** `toDeno()`: Now properly supports `waitUntil`

  - Folded the serverless runtime entry point into the main build – importing `@voltagent/core` now auto-detects the runtime and provisions either the Node or serverless observability pipeline.
  - Rebuilt serverless observability on top of `BasicTracerProvider`, fetch-based OTLP exporters, and an execution-context `waitUntil` hook. Exports run with exponential backoff, never block the response, and automatically reuse VoltOps credentials (or fall back to the in-memory span/log store) so VoltOps Console transparently swaps to HTTP polling when WebSockets are unavailable.
  - Hardened the runtime utilities for Workers/Functions: added universal `randomUUID`, base64, and event-emitter helpers, and taught the default logger to emit OpenTelemetry logs without relying on Node globals. This removes the last Node-only dependencies from the serverless bundle.

  ```ts
  import { Agent, VoltAgent } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { serverlessHono } from "@voltagent/serverless-hono";
  import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

  import { weatherTool } from "./tools";

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "serverless-assistant",
    instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  });

  const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
    agents: { assistant },
    serverless: serverlessHono(),
  });

  export default voltAgent.serverless().toCloudflareWorker();
  ```

  ## @voltagent/serverless-hono
  - Renamed the edge provider to **serverless** and upgraded it to power any fetch-based runtime (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, Deno Deploy, Netlify Functions).
  - Wrapped the Cloudflare adapter in a first-class `HonoServerlessProvider` that installs a scoped `waitUntil` bridge, reuses the shared routing layer, and exposes a `/ws` health stub so VoltOps Console can cleanly fall back to polling.
  - Dropped the manual environment merge – Workers should now enable the `nodejs_compat_populate_process_env` flag (documented in the new deployment guide) instead of calling `mergeProcessEnv` themselves.

  ## @voltagent/server-core
  - Reworked the observability handlers around the shared storage API, including a new `POST /setup-observability` helper that writes VoltOps keys into `.env` and expanded trace/log queries that match the serverless storage contract.

  ## @voltagent/cli
  - Added `volt deploy --target <cloudflare|vercel|netlify>` to scaffold the right config files. The Cloudflare template now ships with the required compatibility flags (`nodejs_compat`, `nodejs_compat_populate_process_env`, `no_handle_cross_request_promise_resolution`) so new projects run on Workers without extra tweaking.

- Updated dependencies [[`f4fa7e2`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/f4fa7e297fec2f602c9a24a0c77e645aa971f2b9)]:
